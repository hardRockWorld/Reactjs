# Handle Events

here, we are trying to handle various events in react.

looking at 2 type of events:

- onClick Event
- onChange Event

React uses Synthetic Base Event (not browser event), something like a virtual event. Mostly in chrome base browsers it shows are this kind of event.

But on other browsers like firefox, it shows as event object (does not show as synthetic base event).
