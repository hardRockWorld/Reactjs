# Passing data using Props

- Data is passed using one i.e from parent to the child component

- we use props in-order to send the data from parent to child

- Props is nothing but an object which is immutable, means that which cannot be changed, but can be destructured and stored in a separate variable as always

- sometimes, you also need type validation for props
