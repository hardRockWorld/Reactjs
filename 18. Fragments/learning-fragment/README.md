# React Fragments

It is used to wrap your content of the component without adding an extra node to the root and bypasses errors.

## Using React Fragments in your react components

- you need to first import React from React, like this:
  import React from "react";

- then, you can wrap your code using <React.Fragment></React.Fragment> OR you can also use alternative syntax for React Fragment, like this:
  <></>
